## My approach :sunglasses:

For this challenge I used Kotlin as a programming language. I also tried to follow the Separation of Concerns design principle while implemeting the MVVM structure and Android Jetpack Library. 

## Design :dancer:

For the UI of the app I went with a clean minimalist design and used Google material design components.

## Requirements :dart:	
All the requirements have been completed :heavy_check_mark:
 - [x] The user should have to find a minimum of 10 pairs to win.
 - [x] Keep track of how many pairs the user has found.
 - [x] When the user wins, display a message to let them know!
 - [x] Make sure it compiles successfully.

## Bonus :star:	
>1.  Make the game configurable to match 3 or 4 of the same products instead of 2.
>2.  Make the grid size configurable. (The player needs to match more than 10 sets of the same product).

I implemented the above bonus features in the Game settings screen. To implement this screen I used the Android Jetpack Preference Library.
